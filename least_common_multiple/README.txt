Least Common Multiple
Given a list of integers, create a function that will find the smallest positive integer that is evenly divisible by all the members of the list. In other words, find the least common multiple (LCM).

Examples
lcm([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) ➞ 2520

lcm([5]) ➞ 5

lcm([5, 7, 11]) ➞ 385

lcm([5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77]) ➞ 385
