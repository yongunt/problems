Word Overlapping
Given two words, overlap them in such a way, morphing the last few letters of the first word with the first few letters of the second word. Return the shortest overlapped word possible.

Examples
overlap("sweden", "denmark") ➞ "swedenmark"

overlap("edabit", "iterate") ➞ "edabiterate"

overlap("honey", "milk") ➞ "honeymilk"

overlap("dodge", "dodge") ➞ "dodge"

Notes
All words will be given in lowercase.
If no overlap is possible, return both words one after the other (example #3).
