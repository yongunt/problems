Bacterial Growth
A bacterial culture on day 1 has only one bacterium with mass 1. Every day, some number of bacteria will split (possibly zero or all). When a bacterium of mass m splits, it becomes two bacteria of mass m/2 each. Also, every night, the mass of every bacteria will increase by one.

Write a function that determines the minimum number of nights for the culture to reach the final_mass.

Examples
bacteria(9) ➞ 3

# Day 1
# The bacterium with mass 1 splits. There are now two bacteria with mass 0.5 each.

# Night 1
# All bacteria's mass increases by one. There are now two bacteria with mass 1.5.

# Day 2
# None split.

# Night 2
# There are now two bacteria with mass 2.5.

# Day 3
# Both bacteria split. There are now four bacteria with mass 1.25.

# Night 3
# There are now four bacteria with mass 2.25.
# The total mass is 2.25 + 2.25 + 2.25 + 2.25 = 9.
# It can be proved that 3 is the minimum number of nights needed.
# There are also other ways to obtain total mass 9 in 3 nights.

bacteria(16) ➞ 4

bacteria(548) ➞ 9

bacteria(5467) ➞ 12
Notes
This is a simplified version of D. Phoenix and Science.
The input will always be an integer.
