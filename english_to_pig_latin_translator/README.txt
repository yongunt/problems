English to Pig Latin Translator

Pig latin has two very simple rules:

If a word starts with a consonant move the first letter(s) of the word, till you reach a vowel, to the end of the word and add "ay" to the end.
have ➞ avehay
cram ➞ amcray
take ➞ aketay
cat ➞ atcay
shrimp ➞ impshray
trebuchet ➞ ebuchettray

If a word starts with a vowel add "yay" to the end of the word.
ate ➞ ateyay
apple ➞ appleyay
oaken ➞ oakenyay
eagle ➞ eagleyay
Write two functions to make an English to pig latin translator. The first function translate_word(word) takes a single word and returns that word translated into pig latin. The second function translate_sentence(sentence) takes an English sentence and returns that sentence translated into pig latin.

Examples

translate_word("flag") ➞ "agflay"

translate_word("Apple") ➞ "Appleyay"

translate_word("button") ➞ "uttonbay"

translate_word("") ➞ ""

translate_sentence("I like to eat honey waffles.") ➞ "Iyay ikelay otay eatyay oneyhay afflesway."

translate_sentence("Do you think it is going to rain today?") ➞ "Oday ouyay
