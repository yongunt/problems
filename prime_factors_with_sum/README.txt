Prime Factors with Sum
Create a function that takes a list of positive integers and returns a string as:

p1, sum of all ij of the list for which p1 is a prime factor.
p2, sum of all ij of the list for which p2 is a prime factor, ... .
pn, sum of all ij of the list for which pn is a prime factor.

Examples
sum_prime([12, 15]) ➞ "(2 12)(3 27)(5 15)"
# 2 is a prime factor of 12 results (2 12).
# 3 is a prime factor of 12 and 15, add 15 + 12, results (3 27).
# 5 is a prime factor of 15 results (5 15).
# 7, 11 and 13 are prime numbers but not a factor of any of the number
# in the given list.

sum_prime([7, 13, 18, 23, 24]) ➞ "(2 42)(3 42)(7 7)(13 13)(23 23)"

sum_prime([3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]) ➞ "(3 12)(5 5)(7 7)(11 11)(13 13)"
