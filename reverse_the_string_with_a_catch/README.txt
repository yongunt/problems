Reverse the String (with a catch)
Create a function that takes a string and returns the reversed string. However there's a few rules to follow in order to make the challenge interesting:

The UPPERCASE/lowercase positions must be kept in the same order as the original string (see example #1 and #2).
Spaces must be kept in the same order as the original string (see example #3).

Examples
special_reverse_string("Edabit") ➞ "Tibade"

special_reverse_string("UPPER lower") ➞ "REWOL reppu"

special_reverse_string("1 23 456") ➞ "6 54 321"
