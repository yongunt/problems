The Secret Bases of Words
In this challenge, you have to find the numeric value of a given word. Instead of the usual sum of Unicode values, you have to convert the whole word into a decimal number from a base equal to ten plus the position in the alphabet of the "highest" letter of the word (counting from a = 1 to z = 26).

Here's an illustrative example. In the word "Edabit" the highest letter in the alphabet is t. Since t is the 20th letter of the alphabet, we thus regard "Edabit" as a number in base-30 (since 10+20=30). Next, we note that in base-30 the letters e, d, a, b, i, t represent, respectively, the numbers 14, 13, 10, 11, 18, 29. Thus, we compute:

14 * 30**5 + 13 * 30**4 + 10 * 30**3 + 11 * 30**2 + 18 * 30 + 29 = 351010469
... which shows that "Edabit" regarded as a number in base-30 is the number 351010469 in base-10.

Goal
Implement a function that, given a word, returns an integer being the decimal value obtained after the conversion from the word specific base, according to the instructions above.

Examples
word_to_decimal("Edabit") ➞ 351010469
# The highest letter of "Edabit" in the alphabet is "t"
# "t" is the 20th letter of the alphabet: adding 10 the result is 30
# "Edabit" in base-30 is equal to 351010469 in base-10

word_to_decimal("Python") ➞ 1365333188
# The highest letter of "Python" in the alphabet is "y"
# "y" is the 25th letter of the alphabet: adding 10 the result is 35
# "Python" in base-35 is equal to 1365333188 in base-10

word_to_decimal("ZERO") ➞ 1652100
# The highest letter of "ZERO" in the alphabet is "Z"
# "Z" is the 26th letter of the alphabet: adding 10 the result is 36
# "ZERO" in base-36 is equal to 1652100 in base-10

Notes
The bases that accept letters in their representation are those starting from 11 (using 10 digits and 1 letter) up to 36 (using 10 digits and 26 letters).
Every given word will be a valid one made of just letters, either lowercase or uppercase. Note, however, that uppercase and lowercase do not affect the value of each letter.
