First Letter Shift
Given a sentence, create a function which shifts the first letter of each word to the next word in the sentence (shifting right).

Examples
shift_sentence("create a function") ➞ "freate c aunction"

shift_sentence("it should shift the sentence") ➞ "st ihould shift she tentence"

shift_sentence("the output is not very legible") ➞ "lhe tutput os iot nery vegible"

shift_sentence("edabit") ➞ "edabit"

Notes
The last word shifts its first letter to the first word in the sentence.
All sentences will be given in lowercase.
Note how single words remain untouched (example #4).
