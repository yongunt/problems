Crack the Pin Code
Given a keypad that has the following layout:

┌───┬───┬───┐
│ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │
├───┼───┼───┤
│ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │
├───┼───┼───┤
│ 7 │ 8 │ 9 │
└───┼───┼───┘
    │ 0 │
    └───┘
Your secret agent Mubashir has already given you a pincode. However, he also said it's possible that each of the digits he saw could be another adjacent digit (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally).

Suppose the secret agent has given you the code: 46:

# Instead of the 4 it could also be 1, 5, or 7.
# Instead of the 6 it could also be 3, 5, or 9.

crack_pincode("46") ➞
["13","15","16","19","43","45","46","49","53","55","56","59","73","75","76","79"]
Create a function that takes an argument of pincode informed by your secret agent and returns a list of all possible variations of the pin codes.

Examples
crack_pincode("0") ➞ ["0", "8"]

crack_pincode("2") ➞ ["1", "2", "3", "5"]

crack_pincode("007") ➞ ["004","007","008","084","087","088","804","807","808","884","887","888"]

Notes
All pin codes must be strings, because of potentially leading 0s.
