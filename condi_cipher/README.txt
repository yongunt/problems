Condi Cipher
In Condi Cipher, encoding is done by shifting a string of messages in correspondence with a given key in the plaintext.

Create a function that takes three arguments, key, shift and message, and returns the encoded message.

There are some variations on the rules of encipherment. One version of the cipher rules are outlined below:

message = "on.,"
shift = 10
key = "cryptogram"

condi_cipher(message, key, shift) ➞ "jx.,"
Step 1: Remove duplicate alphabets of the key. Rearrange alphabets from A-Z, such that the keyword appears first, followed by the rest of the alphabets in the usual order.

c r y p t o g a m b d e f h i j k l n q s u v w x z
Step 2: Starting from 1, assign numbers to the letters:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13
c  r  y  p  t  o  g  a  m  b  d  e  f 
14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
h  i  j  k  l  n  q  s  u  v  w  x  z

Step 3: Replace each alphabet of the message with the letter in the modified key shifter by a constant positive number shift (wrapping is required if the shift is greater than key size):

   'o' = 'j'
# 'j' is 10 places right to 'o'

Step 4: Use the position of the previous letter as the number of places to move to encode the next plaintext number. If you have just encoded an 'o' (position 6), and you now want to encode 'n', then you have to move 6 places to the right from 'n' which brings you to 'x'.

   'n' = 'x'
# 'x' is 6 places right to 'n'
# keep other characters in same order

eMessage = "jx.,"
See the below examples for a better understanding:

Examples
condi_cipher("on.,", "cryptogam", 10) ➞ "jx.,"

condi_cipher("mubashir", "airforce", 6) ➞ "ugrdtfko"

condi_cipher("matt", "edabit", 2) ➞ "opgk"
